#  Container Security Foundations

In this chapter we first have a look at the conceptual underpinning of container security. It's the defense in depth principle we apply throughout. We then review the foundational topics of identity, authentication, and authorization, as well as have a look how a secure supply chain can be used.

## Defense In Depth

The defense in depth (DID) onion diagram we're using throughout the book, looks as follows:

![Defense in depth onion diagram](ch2_did-onion.png)

Some notes to the DID diagram:

1. User data
   a. The business core data itself
   b. Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
   c. Gotchas: leaks, GDPR (in Europe)
2. Configuration data 
   a. Sensitive configuration data (passwords, API keys), see the [Sensitive Data](#ch_secrets) chapter
   b. Gotchas: commits-to-source, non-separated access (for example, dev has clear-text passwords)
3. Source code
   a. Static code analysis 
   b. Runtime, for example, sanitizing user input
   c. Gotchas: log-leaking
4. Dependencies
   a. Source code and binary-level
   b. Code analysis
   c. Gotchas: big surface, many languages
5. Containers
   a. Runtimes and images, see the [Containers](#ch_containers) chapter
   b. Orchestration, see the [Container Orchestrators](#ch_co) chapter
   c. Containers share a kernel (mitigations: Firecracker, gVisor)
   d. Gotchas: unnecessary privileged users, no scans, trust
6. Host
   a. Compare full blown distro (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux) vs. minimal environment (container-optimized distributions)
   b. Multi-tenancy requirements
   c. Gotchas: Linux packages/CVEs,leaks, GDPR (in Europe)

There are several resources available that document and/or advice on good and bad practices, that is, things one should implement and what to avoid best, for example:

- UK's [Security architecture anti-patterns](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/security-architecture-anti-patterns) 
- [The Kubernetes Security Process](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/05/kubernetes-security-process-explained/)
- [Security Goals - Automatic compliance reporting for Kubernetes](https://github.com/cds-snc/security-goals) of the Canadian Digital Service


{id: foundations-identity}
## Identity

[Identity management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management) revolves around *entities* such as people or an application and their respective digital representation. An entity can have multiple identities with different attributes attached, potentially context-dependent.

{aside}
### EXAMPLE: Identity

When you're visiting a website in your web browser, there are at least three entities involved:

- You, the human being.
- Your web browser.
- The website.

For example, when I look at `mhausenblas.info`, I'd encounter something like the following:

![Example website identity](ch2_mhausenblas.info-identity.png)

Inspecting the website's identity reveals that I'm using a self signed certificate, which is understandable given it's a GitHub page. 
{/aside}

In the context of containerized microservices, managing identities is such a central and necessary topic that an entire specification exists: the Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone [SPIFFE](https://spiffe.io/).

Every cloud provider has identity solutions[^awsiam].

Kubernetes has, with its service account abstraction, a very explicit and clean way to [deal with identity](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/kubernetes-identity-management-authentication).

[^awsiam]: See, for example, [An overview of IAM in AWS](https://medium.com/@sirech/an-overview-of-iam-in-aws-1d9cbb1b31a4) for an introduction to how it works in Amazon's case.


{id: foundations-authn}
## Authentication

In the context of this book, we define:

Authentication
: The process of confirming the identity claimed by an entity.

This means, based on a claim of an entity, there is a sequence of steps that either leads to confirming the claim, or not.

{aside}
### EXAMPLE: Authentication

For example, I can claim to be an Austrian living in Ireland. The authentication processes could be as follows:

1. Show me your passport, which confirms I have a valid Austrian citizenship.
1. Provide proof of residence, for example, through an utility bill to an Irish address, in my name. This proofs (to a certain extent) that I live in Ireland.

This example also shows to things: it's always a matter of trust (in certain artifacts such as the bill) as well as that while it's possible to verify a claim, the opposite is usually not possible. How do I proof to you that I am *not* living in, say, Austria? :)
{/aside}

{id: foundations-authz}
## Authorization

In the context of this book, we define:

Authorization
: The set of *privileges* assigned to an *entity* specifying access to a *resource*.

You can simplify that to: access control for authenticated entities.

{aside}
### EXAMPLE: Authorization

Look at this file here:

```sh
~/tmp
$ ls -al MINE
-rw-------  1 mhausenblas  mhausenblas  0 30 May 14:30 MINE
```

What's the authorization regime here? Well, I as the entity (or: user) `mhausenblas` have the privileges (or: rights) to both read and write the resource (or: file) `MINE`. Needless to say that declaring this with `chmod 600 MINE` is pretty useless, if there would not be a piece of software enforcing said authorization.
